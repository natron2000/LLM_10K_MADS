Our future performance is subject to risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. We may be subject to other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us. In addition, please see our note about forward-looking statements included in the MD&A.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Our revenue is subject to volatility in metal prices, which could negatively affect our results of operations or cash flow.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Market prices for gold, silver, copper, and other metals may fluctuate widely over time and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include metal supply and demand, industrial and jewelry fabrication, investment demand, central banking actions, inflation and interest rates, currency values, forward sales by metal producers, and legal, political, social, trade, economic, and banking conditions.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Our revenue is directly tied to metal prices and is particularly sensitive to changes in the price of gold, as we derive the majority of our revenue from gold stream and royalty interests. Under our stream agreements, we purchase metal at a fixed price or a stated percentage of the market price and then sell the metal in the open market during the term of the contract. If market prices decline, our revenue and cash flow from metal sales could also decline. A price decline could also impact our revenue under certain sliding-scale royalty agreements, as we may receive a lower royalty rate when prices fall below specified thresholds. In addition, some of our royalty agreements are based on the operator’s concentrate sales to smelters and allow for price adjustments between the operator and the smelter based on changes in metals prices between the date an operator ships concentrate to its offtake customer and the date the sale of concentrate is finally settled (typically a period of three to five months). These price adjustments can decrease our revenue in future periods if metal prices decline following shipment.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Metal price declines could cause an operator to reduce, suspend, or terminate production or development at a project, which would impact our future revenue from the project. These production or development decisions could prevent us from recovering our initial investment in the project or result in an impairment to the value of our initial investment.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,We own nonoperating interests in mining properties and cannot ensure properties are developed or operated in our best interests.\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Our revenue is derived entirely from stream and royalty interests in properties owned and operated by third parties. In general, we have no decision-making authority regarding the development or operation of the mineral properties underlying our stream and royalty interests. Operators make all or substantially all development and operating decisions, including decisions about permitting, feasibility analysis, mine design and operation, processing, plant and equipment matters, temporary or permanent suspension of operations, estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves, and the marketing of products from the property. The operators of the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests may make decisions that are adverse to our interests.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"The operators of the projects in which we hold an interest may from time to time announce transactions, including the sale or transfer of the projects in which we hold stream or royalty interests or of the operator itself, over which we have little or no control. If such transactions are completed, it may result in a new operator controlling the project, who may not have comparable skills to, or interests of, the operator in place at the time of our investment, any of which could negatively impact our interests.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We often have limited access to data about the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests, which may make it difficult for us to project or assess the performance of our stream and royalty interests or to confirm mineral reserves and mineral resources.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We often do not have the contractual right under our stream and royalty agreements to receive permitting, development, production, operating, and other data with respect to the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests or the right\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"to access the properties or obtain drilling and metallurgical data that would allow us to confirm mineral reserves and mineral resources or other data applicable to the properties. As a result, it may be difficult for us to project or assess the performance of a stream or royalty interest, and we generally are unable to conduct our own mineral reserve and mineral resource analysis.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Our stream and royalty interests may not result in anticipated returns or may not otherwise ultimately benefit our business.\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We are continually reviewing opportunities to acquire new stream and royalty interests, and we have acquisition opportunities at various stages of review. Any acquisition could be material to us. At times, we also may consider ways to restructure our existing stream or royalty interests where we believe the restructuring would provide a long-term benefit to us, even though it could reduce near-term revenues or result in the incurrence of transaction-related costs. The success of our stream and royalty interests is based in part on our ability to make accurate assumptions at the time of acquisition or restructuring about the amount and timing of revenue to be derived from those interests. These assumptions are based on a variety of factors, including the geological, geotechnical, hydrogeological, hydrological, metallurgical, legal, permitting, environmental, social, and other aspects of the projects. For development projects, we also make assumptions about the cost, timing, and conduct of development. If an operator fails to bring a project into production as expected or if actual performance otherwise falls short of our assumptions, our revenue derived from the project may not be sufficient to yield an adequate, or any, return on our investment. In addition, we could be required to decrease the carrying value of our investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot ensure that any acquisition or other transaction will ultimately benefit Royal Gold.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Our future success depends on our ability to acquire additional stream or royalty interests at appropriate valuations.\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Our future success depends largely on our ability to acquire additional stream and royalty interests at appropriate valuations. We may not adequately assess technical, operational, legal, environmental or social risks in connection with new acquisitions, which could adversely impact our expected investment returns or future results of operations. We may not be able to identify and complete acquisitions of additional interests at appropriate prices or terms. We may not have sufficient liquidity or may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing at an acceptable cost of capital in order to fund acquisitions due to economic volatility, credit crises, declines in metal prices, or changes in legal, political, social or other conditions. In addition, certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do, and we may not be able to compete effectively against them. Further, there has been significant growth in the number and relative size of stream and royalty companies over the last several years, and some of these companies may have different investment criteria and costs of capital than we do, or are subject to different tax and accounting rules than we are, and we may not be able to compete effectively against them. Changes to tax rules, accounting policies, or the treatment of stream interests by debt ratings agencies could make streams or royalties less attractive to operators or render us less able to compete with other stream and royalty companies that are organized in countries with more favorable tax, accounting and regulatory regimes.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"For some properties, we may not realize all of the expected benefits of our investments if operators are unable to replace current mineral reserves as they are consumed or identify new mineral resources, which could impact our future results of operations.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"For some properties, our return on investment depends in part on the operators’ ability to replace mineral reserves as they are consumed in the ordinary course of mining. If current mineral reserves are not replaced as they are mined through conversion of mineral resources to new mineral reserves, or new mineral resources are not identified through expansion of known deposits, exploration, or otherwise, our expected investment returns or future results of operations could be adversely affected.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"A significant portion of our revenue comes from a small number of operating properties, which means that adverse developments at these properties could have a more significant or lasting impact on our results of operations than if our revenue was less concentrated.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Approximately 72% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, came from 6 properties: Mount Milligan (26%), Cortez (16%), Pueblo Viejo (13%), Andacollo (8%), Khoemacau (6%), and Peñasquito (3%). We expect these properties to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue going forward. This concentration of revenue could mean that adverse developments, including any adverse decisions made by the operators, at one or more of these properties could have a more significant or longer-term impact on our results of operations than if our revenue was less concentrated.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,A significant disruption to our information technology systems or those of our third-party service providers could adversely affect our business and operating results.\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We rely on a variety of information technology systems to manage and support our operations. For example, we depend on our information technology systems for financial reporting, operational and investment management, and email. These systems contain, among other information, our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees. The proper functioning of these systems and the security of such data is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business, and these functions are outsourced by us to third-party service providers on whom we rely for the proper functioning and security of these systems. In addition, these systems could require modifications or upgrades from time to time as a result of technological changes or growth in our business, and we may change the third-party service providers with whom we contract to maintain the functioning or security of these systems from time to time, which modifications, upgrades or changes could be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management’s time. Our systems, and those of our third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, viruses, ransomware or malware, physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized access, or cyber-attacks.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Any security breach could compromise our networks, and the information stored on them could be improperly accessed, disclosed, lost, stolen or restricted. Because techniques used to sabotage systems, obtain unauthorized access to systems or prohibit authorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not detected until successfully launched against a target, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques, and the cybersecurity processes, technologies and controls that we or our third-party service providers have implemented to secure our systems and electronic information may not be adequate to prevent a disruption or attack or to timely assess, identify and manage a cyber-attack. Actions taken by us or third-party service providers in response to a cyber-attack may not be adequate. Any unauthorized activities could disrupt our operations or those of our third-party service providers on which we are dependent; result in the misappropriation or compromise of confidential information, extortion, or fraud; harm our employees or counterparties; cause us to violate privacy or security laws; or result in legal claims or proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or operating results.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We depend on the services of our executives and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these individuals could harm our business.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We believe that our success depends on retaining qualified executives and other key employees, especially in light of our limited number of personnel and the specialized nature of our business. These individuals have significant industry and Company-specific experience. If we are unsuccessful at retaining or attracting qualified personnel, our business could be disrupted and our reputation could be harmed, adversely impacting our ability to achieve our business objectives. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance on any of these individuals or our directors.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial position, and/or the trading price of our stock.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks could cause significant volatility and uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets, supply chain issues, labor shortages, and declines in metal prices, and such events could adversely affect our ability to obtain future debt or equity financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms, or at all, and could require temporary curtailments of operations at the properties subject to our stream and royalty interests, as occurred\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"at Mount Milligan, Pueblo Viejo, Peñasquito and Khoemacau in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. In addition, health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks and their resulting impacts may make it difficult for the operators of the properties subject to our stream and royalty interests to forecast expected production amounts. The effects of health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks will ultimately depend on many factors that are outside of our control (including the severity and duration of such events and government and operator actions in response to such events) and could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial position, and/or the trading price of our stock.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Our revenue is subject to operational and other risks faced by operators of the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests.\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We generally are not required to pay capital or operating costs on projects in which we hold stream or royalty interests.

Our activities and operators’ activities are subject to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign countries or other sovereign jurisdictions, including the following:\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,expropriation or nationalization of mining property or other government takings\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,seizure of mineral production\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,exchange and currency controls and fluctuations\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,limitations on foreign exchange or repatriation of earnings\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,restrictions on mineral production or price controls\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,governmental regulations relating to foreign investment and the mining business or changes in the interpretation of such regulations\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"import or export regulations, including trade wars and sanctions and restrictions on metal exports\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"changes in government taxation, royalties, tariffs, or duties\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"changes in economic, trade, diplomatic, or other relationships between countries or the effects on global and economic conditions, the stability of global financial markets, or the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets, including the imposition of sanctions on doing business with certain governments, companies or individuals\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,high rates of inflation\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"unfamiliar or uncertain foreign real estate, mineral tenure, safety, or environmental laws or rules\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"war, crime, terrorism, sabotage, blockades, hostage taking, or other forms of civil unrest\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"uncertain political or economic environments, including economic downturns\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,corruption\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, child labor or forced labor laws\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,suspension of the enforcement of creditors’ or stockholders’ rights\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"loss of access to government-controlled infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, rails, ports, power sources, and water supplies\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"In addition, because many of our operators are organized outside of the United States, our stream and royalty interests may be subject to the application of foreign laws to our operators, and their stockholders, including laws relating to taxation,\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"foreign ownership structures, corporate transactions, creditors’ rights, bankruptcy and liquidation. Foreign operations also could be adversely impacted by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"These risks may limit or disrupt the development or operation of properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests or impair our rights or interests in these properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"If the assumptions underlying operators’ production, mineral reserve, or mineral resource estimates are inaccurate or if future events cause operators to negatively adjust their previous estimates, our future revenue or the value of our investments could be adversely affected.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"The operators of the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests generally prepare production, mineral reserve, and mineral resource estimates for the properties. We do not independently prepare or verify this information and generally lack sufficient information and access to properties to do so. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in these estimates, many of which are outside the operators’ control. As a result, production, mineral reserve, and mineral resource estimates are subjective and necessarily depend upon a number of assumptions, including, among others, reliability of historical data; geological interpretation; geotechnical, geologic and mining conditions; metallurgical recovery; metal prices; operating costs; capital expenditures; development and reclamation costs; mining technology improvements; and the effects of government regulation. If any of the assumptions that the operators make in connection with production, mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are incorrect, actual production could be significantly lower than the production, mineral reserve, and mineral resource estimates, which could adversely affect our future revenue and the value of our investments. In addition, if the operators’ estimates with respect to the timing of production are incorrect, we could experience variances in expected revenue from period to period.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Further, operators’ estimates of mineral resources are subject to future exploration and development and associated risks, and estimated mineral resources may never convert to future mineral reserves. In addition, estimates of mineral resources are subject to similar uncertainties and assumptions as discussed above with respect to mineral reserves.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"The operators of properties subject to our interests may be subject to growing environmental risks, including risks associated with climate change, which could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition or the value of our interests or of our common stock.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Mining operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing land use and the protection of the environment. In addition, many countries have implemented laws and regulations designed to address the effects of climate change, including rules to disclose and reduce industrial emissions and other environmental impacts to which operators or we may be subject. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving in a manner generally expected to result in stricter standards, more liability, and increased costs. Compliance with these laws and regulations can impose substantial costs and burdens on the operators of the properties subject to our interests and perhaps on us as well. In addition, an operator’s failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in injunctive action, orders to suspend or cease operations, damages, or civil or criminal penalties on the operator. If any of these events were to occur, our revenue or the value of our interests could be adversely affected.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Climate change may also pose physical risks to the properties in which we hold an interest. This could include adverse effects on operations as a result of increasing occurrences of extreme weather events, flooding, water shortages, changes in rainfall and storm patterns, changes in sea levels, heat stress, wildfires, and other negative weather and climate patterns. For example, Andacollo experienced flooding due to a significant rainfall event in July 2022, which caused operations to shut down for five days and negatively impacted production over the following six months. These events could damage assets, impact production, harm human life, halt mining operations, temporarily close supporting infrastructure or reduce labor productivity, among other effects.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Market impacts due to climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy will be varied and complex. Supply and demand for certain commodities, products and services may shift in connection with evolving consumer and investor sentiments. Market perceptions of the mining sector, and, in particular, the role that certain metals will or will not play in the transition to a low-carbon economy, remain uncertain. Potential financial impacts may include increased production\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"costs due to changing input prices, re-pricing of land and assets, increased global competition for key materials needed for new technologies, potential cost increases by insurers and lenders, and potential increases in taxation of the mining and metals sector.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"In addition, governments and investors are increasingly seeking enhanced disclosures on the risks, challenges, governance implications, and financial impacts of climate change faced by companies and demanding that companies take a proactive approach to addressing and reducing perceived environmental risks, including the physical, transition and liability risks associated with climate change, relating to their operations. Adverse publicity or climate-related litigation that impacts any of the operators of the principal properties in which we hold interests could have a negative impact on our business. As a holder of stream and royalty interests, we generally will not have any influence on litigation such as this and more than likely not have access to non-public information concerning such litigation. In addition, we may not have access to sufficient information on the operations in respect of which we hold stream and royalty agreements in order to adequately comply with regulations or meet stockholder expectations on adequate disclosure or to quantify the potential impacts of climate change on our business.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Challenges relating to climate change could have an impact on the ability of operators to access the capital markets, and such limitations could have a corresponding negative effect on their business and operations. Although we do not conduct mining operations on the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests and are not legally required to contribute to environmental or other operating costs on the properties, our own governmental regulators and stockholders may nonetheless demand that we assist the operators of the properties with addressing these environmental risks. If this were to occur, the value of our interests or of our common stock could be adversely affected.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Further, due to expansive environmental laws, it is possible that we could become subject to environmental liabilities for historic periods during which we owned or operated properties or relative to our current ownership interests in mining claims or leases. These liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Finally, lenders may be unwilling to provide financing to the mining industry, including companies like Royal Gold that acquire stream and royalty interests in mining projects, due to such lenders’ concerns regarding market perceptions of the mining sector and lender commitments to net-zero emissions targets. If we encounter difficulties in accessing the commercial debt market, our ability to finance new acquisitions of stream and royalty interests could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we have to rely on issuing equity to finance transactions, our stock price could be negatively impacted, and our stockholders’ ownership could be diluted.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Evolving expectations regarding ESG matters may adversely impact our business, including as a result of additional costs, reputational damage and/or litigation.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Companies across industries are facing increasing scrutiny from a variety of stakeholders related to their ESG practices. As a passive investor in mining operations, our ESG initiatives and disclosures are often based on information from the operators of the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests and other third parties, and we generally lack sufficient data or access to properties to verify such information. Evolving expectations regarding ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs for the operators and us, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other impacts to our business. In addition, our ESG initiatives and disclosures may subject us to other adverse impacts, including reputational damage and/or litigation.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Current and future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business.\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"As of December 31, 2023, we had $250 million outstanding and $750 million available under our revolving credit facility. We may incur additional indebtedness. Our credit facility contains a floating interest rate. Our levels of indebtedness and higher interest rates could impact us as follows:\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund acquisitions, working capital, or dividends\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,restrict us from exploiting business opportunities\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,require the consent of our existing lenders to incur additional indebtedness\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"limit our ability to borrow additional funds for acquisitions, working capital, or debt-service requirements\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"increase our cost of capital, including as a result of higher interest rates and the effects of exchange rates\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,decrease our future earnings\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,increase our exposure to the credit risks of bank group lenders or those institutions with which we maintain deposits\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Our credit agreement contains financial and other restrictive covenants. For example, the agreement includes financial covenants that require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as these terms are defined under the agreement). These covenants could limit our ability to engage in activities that are in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default that, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness. Our credit facility expires in June 2028. In the future, we may be unable to obtain new financing or refinancing on acceptable terms.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Defects in our stream or royalty interests or the bankruptcy or insolvency of an operator could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments.\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Despite our due diligence practices, it is possible that unknown defects or problems will exist relating to the existence, validity, enforceability, terms, or geographic extent of our stream and royalty interests. Similarly, stream interests and, in many jurisdictions, royalty interests, are or can be contractual in nature, rather than interests in land. As a result, these interests may not survive a bankruptcy or insolvency of an operator. We often do not have the protection of security interests that could help us recover all or part of our investment in a stream or royalty interest in the event of an operator’s bankruptcy or insolvency. In addition, the contracts governing our stream and royalty interests may not have sufficient legal protections or a court could impose restrictions on our enforcement rights. If our stream or royalty interests were set aside through judicial or administrative proceedings or if we are unable to enforce our contractual rights, the value of our investments could be adversely affected.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Some of the agreements governing our stream and royalty interests contain terms that could adversely affect the revenues generated from those interests.\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Revenue from some of our stream and royalty interests decreases or stops after threshold production, delivery, or payment milestones are achieved or other events occur. For example, our stream interests at Pueblo Viejo, Andacollo and Khoemacau and certain of our royalty interests at other properties contain provisions for stream rate reductions and/or cash price increases. As a result, past production and revenue relating to these interests may not be indicative of future results. In addition, some of our stream and royalty interests do not cover all of the mineral reserves or mineral resources at certain\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"properties, which could mean that overall performance reported by the operators may not correlate to the performance of our interests in the properties.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Operators may fail to comply with their contractual arrangements with us or may interpret their obligations in a manner adverse to us, which could decrease our revenue or increase our costs.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"At times, operators may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. In addition, we often rely on the operators for the calculation of our stream deliveries or royalty payments. There may be errors in the calculations of payments. Payments to us may be delayed by restrictions imposed by the operators’ lenders, financial distress and related events impacting the operators, delays in the sale or delivery of products, or the ability or willingness of smelters and refiners to process mine products. Our rights to payment under our stream and royalty agreements must, in most cases, be enforced by contract. When we enter into new stream or royalty agreements, we attempt to secure contractual rights that allow us to monitor operators’ compliance with their obligations to us, such as audit or access rights. However, these rights may not be sufficient to ensure compliance. In addition, our stream and royalty agreements are often complex and may be subject to interpretation or uncertainties. Operators and other counterparties may interpret our interests in a manner adverse to us. For these or other reasons, we could be forced to expend resources or take legal action to enforce our contractual rights. We may not be successful in enforcing our contractual rights. As a result, our revenue relating to the disputed interests could be adversely affected. We may also need to expend significant monetary and human resources to defend our position, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may be required to make retroactive revenue adjustments in future periods relating to past period revenue as a result of information that we learn through audit or access rights or otherwise from operators and other counterparties.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Changes to U.S. and foreign tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations.\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.\\xa0Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and their interpretation subject to a significant change in any jurisdiction.\\xa0We cannot predict the timing or significance of future tax law changes in the U.S. or other countries in which we do business.\\xa0If material tax law changes are enacted, our future effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Anti-corruption laws and regulations could subject us to liability and require us to incur costs.\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"\"FCPA\"\") and other anticorruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to third parties, including foreign governments and their officials, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In some cases, we invest in mining operations in certain jurisdictions where corruption may be more common. Our international investment activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments in violation of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by one of our employees or agents in violation of our policies. In addition, the operators of the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests may fail to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations. Although we do not operate these properties, enforcement authorities could deem us to have some culpability for the operators’ actions. Any violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could result in significant civil or criminal penalties to us and could have an adverse effect on our reputation.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Our stock price may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"The market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the market price of our common stock ranged from a low of $102.87 to a high of $143.88. Many factors unrelated to operating performance can contribute to volatility in the market price of our common stock, including the following:\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"economic, market, political, social or public health conditions\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"market prices of gold, silver, copper, and other metals\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,developments relating to properties on which we hold stream or royalty interests\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,interest rates and inflation rates and expectations about both\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,currency values\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,credit market conditions\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"Market fluctuations, regardless of cause, may materially and adversely affect our stock price.

If we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted and our per-share financial measures would be reduced. In addition, shares of common stock that we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions. The market price of our common stock could decline if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We may change our practice of paying dividends, which could reduce the value of your investment.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"We have paid a cash dividend on our common stock since calendar year 2000. Our Board of Directors has discretion in determining whether to declare a dividend based on a number of factors, including metal prices, economic or market conditions, earnings, cash flow, financial condition, and funding requirements for future opportunities or operations. In addition, corporate law limitations or future contractual restrictions could limit our ability to pay dividends in the future. If our Board of Directors reduces or eliminates future dividends, our stock price could fall, and the success of your investment would depend largely on any future stock price appreciation. We have increased our dividend in prior years. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to do so or that we will pay any dividends.\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Provisions of Delaware law and our organizational documents could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"The anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose barriers to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. Among other things, these provisions provide for the following:\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"allow our Board of Directors to issue shares of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval, except as may be required by Nasdaq rules\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,allow our Board of Directors to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued preferred stock\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,\"provide for a classified Board, whereby our Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms\"\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,require advance notice of stockholder proposals and related information\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,ListItem,require vacancies and newly created directorships on the Board of Directors to be filled only by affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then serving on the board\\r\\nRISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,\"These provisions could increase the cost of acquiring us or discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, which could decrease the value of your investment.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"In 2018, the SEC adopted amendments to the disclosure requirements for mining properties. Effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, the disclosure requirements under the SEC’s Industry Guide 7 (“IG7”) have been replaced with new disclosure requirements under SK1300. The property disclosures in this Item 2 are presented in accordance with SK1300 subject to certain exemptions contained in the rule.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"This Item 2 provides summary information about our overall portfolio of stream and royalty interests, as well as more detailed information about our material properties. Royal Gold management periodically reviews the materiality of individual royalty and stream interests within our portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, we determined that six of our stream and royalty interests are material to our business under SK1300: Andacollo, Cortez, Khoemacau, Mount Milligan, Peñasquito and Pueblo Viejo. We sometimes refer to these properties as our material, or principal, properties. In making this determination, management considers primarily estimated future revenue and, to a lesser extent, historical revenue. Estimated future revenue is based on several factors, including mineral reserves and resources subject to our stream and royalty interests, production estimates, feasibility studies, technical reports, metal price and mine life assumptions.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Under SK1300, disclosures of material mineral reserves and resources must be based on a technical report summary prepared by a qualified person, absent an exemption. With respect to our material properties, our disclosures in this Item 2 are based on information provided to us by the operators of the properties or the operators’ public filings with the SEC or Canadian securities regulators including technical reports filed with Canadian securities administrators pursuant to National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”), 2014 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards and 2019 Best Practice Guideline (“CIM Standards”) and a technical report prepared under the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (“JORC Code”). As of the date of this disclosure, these operators of our material properties have not filed technical report summaries for the properties with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2023.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"We are a stream and royalty company, and as further discussed below, we are relying on the exemption for stream and royalty companies set forth in Section 1302(b)(3)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K, which provides that a stream, royalty or similar company is not required to file a technical report summary with the SEC with respect to an underlying property where the producing mining registrant has filed a current technical report summary for the property or either (a) obtaining the information would result in an unreasonable burden or expense, or (b)\\xa0the company requested the technical report summary from the owner, operator or other person possessing the technical report summary who denied the request. Our summary and individual property disclosures are also provided in accordance with Sections 1303(a)(3) and 1304(a)(2) of\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Regulation S-K, respectively, which provide that a registrant with a stream, royalty or other similar right may omit certain information required by the summary and individual property disclosure requirements if the registrant specifies the information to which it lacks access, explains the reason it lacks the required information and provides all required information that it does possess or which it can acquire without incurring an unreasonable burden or expense.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,Our agreements governing our material property interests do not require the operators to prepare technical report summaries or permit us the access and information sufficient to prepare our own technical report summaries under SK1300.\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"For each of our material properties for which the operator has not filed a current technical report summary under SK1300, we requested that the operator prepare a technical report summary under SK1300 or permit us the access and information necessary for us to prepare our own technical report summary relating to the property for filing with the SEC. In each case, the operator denied our request. None of the operators is an affiliate of Royal Gold. \\xa0As a result, we do not have sufficient rights or access to the information required for us to prepare a technical report summary for such properties.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Mineral resources and mineral reserves discussed in Item 2 are as publicly disclosed or provided to us by the operators of the properties, as of the dates indicated in the disclosure. We do not attempt to account for mineral resource or mineral reserve depletion due to mining activities, nor for mineral resource or mineral reserve expansion due to exploration activities, because we do not have access under our agreements with our operators to the technical data required to account for this depletion or expansion. In accordance with Sections 1303(a)(3) and 1304(a)(4) of SK1300, we are providing all required information in our possession or which we can acquire without incurring an unreasonable burden or expense. The property information included herein contains information reported by our operators in their respective jurisdictions pursuant to SK1300, or applicable mining codes based on the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (“CRIRSCO”), such as JORC Code and NI 43-101. The SEC’s disclosure regime under SK1300, while similar to other CRIRSCO-based codes used in other jurisdictions, does not permit the substitution or reciprocal recognition of resources and reserves determined under the mining disclosure regimes of other jurisdictions. We are providing this information because it represents information that we have in our possession that we consider to be material to our investors. While SK1300 definitions are substantially similar to those set forth in the CIM and JORC Code, there are variations. Therefore, the mineral resources, mineral reserves and other technical information included in this annual report on Form 10-K could vary if it had been determined by a mining operator required to comply with SK1300.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Most of our principal properties are operated by companies that report mineral resources and reserves pursuant to regulatory standards other than SK1300. For example, Barrick as operator of each of Pueblo Viejo and Cortez, Teck Resources Limited (“Teck”) as operator of Andacollo, and Centerra as operator of Mount Milligan, as reporting companies under Canadian securities laws, are permitted under SK1300 to rely on Canadian property and mineral resource and reserve reporting standards required in their home jurisdiction (NI 43-101 in Canada), rather than those set forth in SK1300, under the SEC’s Multijurisdictional Disclosure System. Further, Canadian securities laws and regulations allow annual information forms covering the previous fiscal year to be filed within 90 days (or 120 days in some instances) after the applicable company’s fiscal year end. Khoemacau is privately owned and is also not subject to SEC reporting. Newmont Corporation (“Newmont”), operator of Peñasquito and a party to a joint venture with Barrick on each of Pueblo Viejo and Nevada operations that include Cortez, has filed technical report summaries prepared under SK1300 for each of Peñasquito, Pueblo Viejo and the Nevada operations. Peñasquito, Pueblo Viejo and Cortez are our only principal properties for which property and technical reports are prepared under SK1300. Newmont’s annual report on Form 10-K is subject to the same deadline as this Form 10-K, and thus any new or updated technical report summaries are not filed in time for us to refer to them in this Form 10-K.\\xa0As a result of the foregoing, in most cases, we refer to mineral resource and reserve information for our principal properties as of periods earlier than December 31, 2023, in reliance on the exception to SK1300 pertaining to royalty companies regarding information they do not have under 1302(b)(3), 1303(a)(3) and 1304(a)(2) of SK1300 as discussed above. Any references in this report to the technical report summaries or other information publicly disclosed by the operators of the properties shall not be deemed to incorporate such information by reference into this report or any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates such information by reference.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Internal controls for determining and reporting the mineral resources and mineral reserves disclosed in Item 2 are the internal controls specific to the individual projects and are maintained by the operators. In general, mineral resources and\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"mineral reserves are supported by technical studies relevant to the jurisdictions within which the operators conduct their financial disclosure, and qualified persons specified by the operators (as determined by the laws and disclosure rules in the applicable jurisdictions) have endorsed the quality of the work.

The deposit is hosted within the Ghanzi-Chobe Fold Belt, a series of deformed metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. Deposits within the fold belt typically consist of stratiform copper mineralization within veins between specific rock units.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Zone 5 has a deposit strike length of 4 km with mineralization dipping at 56 degrees to the south-east over an average thickness of 10 m. Mineralization is situated in the hanging wall sequence, 30 m above the contact between the D’Kar Formation and Ngwako Pan Formation. Mineralization is sub-parallel to lithology and typically cross-cuts host units from the lower D’Kar limestone unit in the south-west to the carbon rich siltstone unit and interbedded alternating siltstone and sandstone unit toward the north-east. The host rock assemblage is sandwiched between two competent sandstone units; the footwall Ngwako Pan quartzite sandstone and the hanging wall Marker sandstone. The down dip extension of mineralization has been drilled to a maximum depth of 1,200 m vertically below surface. The deposit remains open at depth (down dip) and partially along strike.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Mineral boundaries were interpreted to distinguish areas that comprised overburden, oxide plus sulfide minerals and sulfide-only assemblages. The near surface mineralized zone was identified as a transitional sulfide zone that contained both oxide and sulfide minerals. The boundary between this zone and the sulfide only undulates parallel to topography between 60 and 75 m deep below the surface. This boundary was defined by acid soluble copper and total copper ratios, logged drill core and recorded specific gravity values. Common minerals found in this zone, in order of abundance, include malachite, bornite, chalcopyrite, native copper and minor chrysocolla. A small zone of deeper oxidation, with\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"mineralization consisting dominantly of native copper, is located in the center portion of the deposit. This area shows strong brecciation and extends to depths of 400 m below the surface.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Economic mineralization consists of massive bornite and chalcocite with accompanying chalcopyrite and silver. Locally, secondary massive chalcocite has replaced bornite in the Central portion of the deposit at the forereef slope. These minerals are largely vein hosted and make up greater than 1.0% Cu grade domain. The mineralization is hosted within an extensive system of quartz and quartz carbonate veins, shears and cleavages. Parallel and sub-parallel shearing continues for hundreds of feet and are likely influenced by subtle changes in lithology and structure. Within the more competent units, shearing is replaced by brittle deformation, generally in the form of brecciation.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Localized parasitic folds, thrusts and shears have thickened the mineralization and repeated the stratigraphy resulting in enhanced copper and silver grades over very wide intervals. Structural data in the NE portion of the deposit suggests a gently plunging fold toward the south-west. The fold is overprinted in the center portion of the deposit by a vertically plunging facies change. These two areas have the highest grades and thickest intervals.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"The Mango deposit is situated 10 km southwest and along strike of the Zone 5 deposit on the southeast limb of a regional anticline.

The driver of the mine schedule is the sulphur blending requirement. Sulphur grade is important because the metallurgical aspects of the processing operation, the recoveries achieved, and the processing costs, all strongly depend on a very consistent, low-variability sulphur content in the plant feed.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"The Pueblo Viejo mine operates a conventional open pit, utilizing a truck and shovel mining operation mining on 10-meter high benches. It achieved commercial production in January 2013 and completed its ramp-up to full design capacity in 2014. Current mining operations supplement fresh ore from the Monte Negro and Moore pits with stockpiled ore to achieve the required ore blend for ore processing.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Equipment planning has considered mine design production of approximately 57 to 63 Mtpa total material movement, including limestone. This includes mill feed, reclamation from stockpiles, and simultaneous mining in the limestone quarries and several operating pit phases. Loading is carried out with 20 m3 hydraulic shovels and 22 m3 front-end loaders, loading 175-tonne haul trucks.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Gold and silver are recovered through pressure oxidation (autoclave) of whole ore and flotation concentrate, followed by hot cure and hot lime boil, prior to cyanidation of gold and silver in a CIL circuit. The autoclave circuit was initially designed to oxidize approximately 1,750 tonnes of sulfide per day, which is equivalent to about 24,000 tonnes of run-of-mine ore at 7.5% of sulfide. The process plant expansion flowsheet includes an additional primary crusher, coarse ore stockpile and ore reclaim delivering to a new single stage semi-autogenous (SAG) mill, and a new flotation circuit that concentrates the bulk of the sulfide ore prior to oxidation. The concentrate is blended with fresh milled ore to feed the modified autoclave circuit, which has additional oxygen supplied from a new 3,000 tonnes per day facility. The existing autoclaves have been upgraded to increase the sulfur processing capacity of each autoclave through additional high-pressure cooling water and recycle flash capability using additional slurry pumping and thickening.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"The TSF is located in the El Llagal valley, located approximately 4 km south of the plant site. The Lower Llagal TSF, made up of one main dam and three saddle dams, will contain all of the waste rock generated over the life of the Pueblo Viejo mine as well as process tailings up to 2028. In addition to solids storage, the Lower Llagal TSF is sized to provide storage for an operating pond and for extreme precipitation events. In conjunction with the plant expansion project, Barrick is currently in the design and permitting stages to construct the new El Naranjo TSF, which is intended to extend the mine life to the mid-2040s.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,The mine initiated pre-stripping in 2010 and the mill was commissioned in 2012.\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,We do not have specific information about the physical condition of equipment and infrastructure at the site.\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,The operator does not provide us with the operator’s book value or total cost detail for the property and associated plant and equipment.\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Early mining activity at the site dates back to the 1500s. Subsequent to that early mining activity, Rosario Resources commenced mining operations on the property in 1975. In 1979, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic purchased all foreign-held shares in Rosario Resources and the Dominican Government continued operations as Rosario Dominicana S.A. Gold and silver production from oxide, transitional, and sulfide ores occurred from 1975 to 1999. The mine ceased operations in 1999. In 2000, the Dominican Republic invited international bids for the leasing and mineral exploitation of the Pueblo Viejo mine site. In July 2001, PVDC (then known as Placer Dome Dominicana Corporation), an affiliate of\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Placer Dome, was awarded the bid. PVDC and the Dominican Republic subsequently negotiated the SLA for the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve, which was ratified by the Dominican National Congress and became effective on July 29, 2003. In March 2006, Barrick acquired Placer Dome and in May 2006 amalgamated the companies. At the same time, Barrick sold a 40% stake in the Pueblo Viejo project to Goldcorp (acquired by Newmont in 2019). On February 26, 2008, PVDC delivered the Project Notice to the Government of the Dominican Republic pursuant to the SLA and delivered the Pueblo Viejo Feasibility Study to the Government. In 2009, the Dominican Republic and PVDC agreed to amend the terms of the SLA. The amendment became effective on November 13, 2009 following its ratification by the Dominican National Congress. The Pueblo Viejo mine achieved commercial production in January 2013. A second amendment to the SLA became effective on October 5, 2013, and has resulted in additional and accelerated tax revenues to the government of the Dominican Republic.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"PVDC has acquired all of the permits necessary to operate the mine at the present time. General Environmental and Natural Resources Law No. 64-00 (“Law 64-00”) of August 18, 2000, and its complementary regulations, governs all environmental related issues, including those applicable to mining, in the Dominican Republic. Law 64-00 sets out the general rules of conservation, protection, improvement, and restoration of the environment and natural resources by unifying segregated rules concerning environmental protection and creating a governmental body (the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources) with wide authority to oversee and regulate its application. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources enforces Law 64-00 and establishes the process of obtaining environmental permits.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"PVDC completed a Feasibility Study on the Mine in September 2005 and presented an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) to the Dominican state in November of the same year. The terms of reference for the Mine were approved by the Environmental Authority on May 30, 2005, and the Ministry of Environment approved the EIA in December 2006 and granted the Environmental License 101-06. Other changes have been submitted to the authorities for additional facilities. The last amendment to the Environmental License was issued on June 29, 2017, which authorized the construction of an emulsion plant. Requirements of the Environmental License included submission of detailed design of tailings dams, installation of monitoring stations, and submission for review of the waste management plan and incineration plant.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"An environmental evaluation report was submitted in 2008 to address an increase in the planned processing rate to 24,000 tpd and in September 2010 the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources issued the Environmental License 101-06 Modified.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"When the former Rosario mine shut down its operations in 1999, proper closure and reclamation was not undertaken. The result has been a legacy of polluted soil and water and contaminated infrastructure. Responsibility for the clean-up is now shared jointly between PVDC and the Dominican government. Terms have been set for both parties in the SLA that governs the development and operation of the mine.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"In November 2009, following approval by the Dominican Republic National Congress, President Leonel Fernandez ratified the first amendment to the SLA for Pueblo Viejo. The amended SLA better reflected the scope and scale of the project since its acquisition by Barrick in 2006. The amendments set out revised fiscal terms and clarified various administrative and operational matters to the mutual benefit of PVDC and the Dominican state. In particular, the agreement stipulates that environmental remediation within the development area is the responsibility of the company with the exception of the hazardous substances; the Dominican government is responsible for historic impacts outside the Mine development area and hazardous substances at the plant site.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"In the second half of 2016, PVDC was contracted to act as an agent of the Dominican State to carry out activities for which the Dominican State is responsible under the SLA pursuant to the Environmental Management Plan of the State (Plan de Administración del Estado). The requisite environmental permits were received in November 2016 to carry out the first stage of the closure plan, which focuses on dewatering, buttressing, and improving the stability of the old Mejita tailings facility. Dewatering of the old Mejita tailings facility was completed in 2018, as well as the geotechnical investigation program. In 2020, the Environmental Management Plan of the State (Plan de Administración del Estado) achieved progress for the Mejita tailings cover component, with work occurring mainly at the north and central ponds.

Open pit operations moved 115 million tonnes of combined ore and waste in 2023. Two different mining methods are used at the underground operations, long-hole open stoping and drift-and-fill. Underground operations at Cortez Hills are based on an ore production rate of 3,500 tpd.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,The gold-recovery process used at the Cortez Complex is determined by considering the grade and metallurgical character of the particular ore: lower grade ROM oxide ore is heap leached at existing facilities; higher-grade non-refractory ore is treated in a conventional mill using cyanidation and the CIL process; and refractory ore is stockpiled on site in designated areas and trucked to the nearby Carlin Complex for processing. Gold recovered from the ore is processed into doré on site and shipped to outside refineries for processing into gold bullion.\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"The active heap leach facilities are located at the Pipeline and Cortez Hills complexes. Milling activities at Cortez are conducted at the Pipeline complex, which includes crushing and grinding facilities, CIL circuits, reagent storage areas and a recovery/refining circuit. Plant throughput can reach up to 16,300 tpd depending on the hardness of the ore being processed.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"The Goldrush underground project is currently in development. The primary access is a set of twin declines developed to allow exploration and initial test stoping on the orebody. The primary method of extraction at the Goldrush mine is longhole open stoping. The basic mining unit is a stope with the dimensions of 15 m (width) by 15 m (strike length) by 20 m (height). The stopes will be extracted on a transverse primary/secondary system with (where possible), a continuous mining front. Broken material is hauled from the mine using 63-tonne capacity haul trucks out of the mine declines. Void space is then filled with cemented rock fill. A paste plant is expected to be constructed to provide backfill.\"\\r\\nPROPERTIES,NarrativeText,\"Most of the Goldrush deposit contains typical double refractory roast-type ore (gold locked in sulfides and organic preg-robbing carbon present).

In 1969, the original Cortez mine went into production. From 1969 to 1997, gold ore was sourced from open pits at Cortez, Gold Acres, Horse Canyon and Crescent. In 1991, the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits were discovered, with development approval received in 1996. In 1998, the Cortez Pediment deposit was discovered, with the Cortez Hills discovery announced in April 2003. The Cortez Hills development was approved by Placer Dome and Kennecott, then joint venturers, in September 2005 and confirmed by Barrick in 2006. Barrick obtained an interest in the Cortez property through its acquisition of Placer Dome in 2006. Barrick consolidated its 100% interest in the property following its purchase of the Kennecott interest in 2008.

The increase in the current period was primarily attributable to higher interest expense as a result of higher interest rates when compared to the prior period. The all-in interest rates as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, were 6.56% and 5.93%, respectively. Refer to Note 5 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our debt.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"Income tax expense was $42.0 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02023, as compared to $32.9 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02022, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 14.9% in the current period and 12.1% in the prior\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"period. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were primarily impacted by the release of valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"We use our liquidity and capital resources to fund dividends and for the acquisition of stream and royalty interests, including any conditional funding schedules. Our short-term and long-term capital requirements are primarily affected by our ongoing acquisition activities. We currently, and generally at any time, have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review. In the event of one or more substantial stream or royalty interest or other acquisitions, we may seek additional debt or equity financing as necessary. We occasionally borrow and repay amounts under our revolving credit facility and may do so in the future. We believe that our current liquidity and capital resources will be adequate to cover our operating needs for the foreseeable future.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"At December\\xa031,\\xa02023, we had working capital of $95 million, including $104.2 million of cash and equivalents. This compares to working capital of $122.2 million, including $118.6 million of cash and equivalents at December 31, 2022. The decrease in our working capital was primarily due to a decrease in our available cash, which resulted from increased debt repayments during the current period.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"During the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02023, liquidity needs were met from $415.8 million in net cash provided by operating activities and our available cash resources. Working capital, combined with the $750 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility, resulted in approximately $845 million of total liquidity at December 31,\\xa02023. Refer to Note\\xa05 of our notes to consolidated financial statements and below (“Recent Liquidity and Capital Resource Developments”) for further discussion on our debt.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"At December\\xa031,\\xa02023, our contractual cash obligations are solely comprised of operating leases. We believe we will be able to fund all current cash obligations from net cash provided by operating activities. For additional information on our operating leases, see Note 6 of our notes to consolidated financial statements.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"Please refer to our risk factors included in Part\\xa0I, Item\\xa01A of this report for a discussion of certain risks that may impact our liquidity and capital resources.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"On December 6, 2023, we made a $75 million principal payment towards the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility leaving $750 million available as of December 31, 2023.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"On November 14, 2023, we announced an increase in our annual dividend for calendar year 2024 from $1.50 to $1.60 per share, payable on a quarterly basis of $0.40 per share. The newly declared dividend is 7% higher than the dividend paid during calendar year 2023. We have steadily increased our annual dividend for 23 years, or since calendar year 2001. We expect to pay our annual dividend using cash on hand.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $415.8 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02023, compared to $417.3 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02022. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest paid on the outstanding revolving credit facility compared to the prior period. This decrease was partially offset by higher proceeds received from our stream and royalty interests, net of cost of sales, compared to the prior period.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2.8 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02023, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $922.9 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02022. The decrease over the prior period was primarily due to the new royalty acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2022.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"Net cash used in financing activities totaled $427.4 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02023, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $480.6 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02022. The change was primarily due to an increase in the debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $575 million that was used to fund acquisitions of our new royalty interests at Cortez and the Great Bear Project, and the repayment of $325 million of debt outstanding during the current period.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"The preparation of our financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"We rely on mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates reported by the operators of the properties on which we hold stream and royalty interests. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the potential impairments of long-lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets. These estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which we recognize revenue or charge depreciation, depletion and amortization to earnings. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Differences between estimates and actual amounts are adjusted and recorded in the period that the actual amounts are known.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"Stream and royalty interests include acquired stream and royalty interests in production, development and exploration stage properties.

Development stage mineral properties, which are not yet in production, are not depleted until the property begins production. Exploration stage mineral properties, where there are no proven and probable mineral reserves, are not depleted. When the associated exploration stage mineral interests are converted to proven and probable mineral reserves, the mineral property becomes a development stage mineral property.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability of the carrying value of stream and royalty interests in production and development stage mineral properties is evaluated based upon estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from each stream and royalty interest using estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves, mineral resources and other relevant information received from the operators. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of royalty interests in exploration stage mineral properties in the event of significant decreases in the price of gold, silver, copper and other metals, and whenever new information regarding the mineral properties is obtained from the operator indicating that production will not likely occur or may be reduced in the future, thus potentially affecting the\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"future recoverability of our stream or royalty interests. Impairments in the carrying value of each property are measured and recorded to the extent that the carrying value in each property exceeds its estimated fair value, which is generally calculated using estimated future discounted cash flows.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"Estimates of gold, silver, copper, and other metal prices, and operators’ estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves or mineral resources related to our stream or royalty properties are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of our investment in these stream and royalty interests in mineral properties.

A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. In accordance with this guidance, revenue attributable to our stream and royalty interests is generally recognized at the point in time that control of the related metal production transfers to our customers, as described below. The amount of revenue we recognize further reflects the consideration to which we are entitled under the respective stream or royalty agreement. A more detailed summary of our revenue recognition policies for our stream and royalty interests is discussed below.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more of the metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement. Gold, silver and copper received under our metal stream agreements are taken into inventory, and then sold primarily using average spot rate gold, silver and copper forward contracts. The sales price for these average spot rate forward contracts is determined by the average daily gold, silver or copper spot prices during the term of the contract, typically a consecutive number of trading days between ten days and three months (depending on the frequency of deliveries under the respective stream agreement and our sales policy in effect at the time) commencing shortly after receipt and purchase of the metal. We settle our forward sales contracts via physical delivery of the metal to the purchaser (our customer) on the settlement date specified in the contract. Under our forward sales contracts, there is a single performance obligation to sell a contractually specified volume of metal to the purchaser, and we satisfy this obligation at the point in time of physical delivery. Accordingly, revenue from our metal sales is recognized on the date of settlement, which is the date that control, custody and title to the metal transfer to the purchaser.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to a percentage of revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. We are entitled to payment for our royalty interest in a mining project based on a contractually specified commodity price (for example, a monthly or quarterly average spot price) for the period in which metal production occurred. As a royalty holder, we act as a passive entity in the production and operations of the mining project, and the third-party operator of the mining project is responsible for all mining activities, including subsequent marketing and delivery of all metal production to their ultimate customer. In all of our material royalty interest arrangements, we have concluded that we transfer control of our interest in the metal production to the operator at the point at which production occurs, and thus, the operator is our customer. We have further determined that the transfer of each unit of metal production, comprising our royalty interest, to the operator represents a separate performance obligation under the contract, and each performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time of metal production by the operator. Accordingly, we recognize revenue attributable to our royalty interests in the period in which metal production occurs at the specified commodity price per the agreement, net of any contractually allowable offsite treatment, refining, transportation and, if applicable, other contractually permitted costs.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"Our annual tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates in effect and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax expense, current tax assets and liabilities, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income, both as a whole and in various tax jurisdictions, for purposes of assessing our ability to realize future benefit from our deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate or unpredicted results from the final determination of each\\xa0year’s liability by taxing authorities.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"We treat global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) as a period cost and therefore do not record deferred tax impacts of GILTI in our consolidated financial statements. Our deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws and regulations. In evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers both positive and negative evidence that may exist, such as earnings history, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies in each tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and other tax planning strategies.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"Our operations may involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution could result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period which they are determined. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,\"This report and our other public communications include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws.

As more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates its stream and royalty interests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\"\\r\\nFINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,\"that the carrying amounts of the asset or group of assets may not be recoverable (“triggering events”). Management evaluates various qualitative factors in determining whether or not events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The factors considered include, among others, significant changes in estimates of forecasted gold, silver, copper and other metal prices, significant changes in operators’ estimates of proven and probable reserves and/or mineral resources and other relevant information received from the operators, which may include operational or legal information that indicates production from mineral interests may not occur or may be significantly reduced in the future or otherwise that the Company\\'s stream and royalty interest balance may not be recoverable.Auditing the Company’s impairment assessment involved our subjective judgment because, in determining whether a triggering event occurred, management uses estimates that include, among others, assumptions about forecasted gold, silver, copper and other metal prices and total future production using reserve or other relevant information reported by the operators. Significant uncertainty exists with these assumptions. Further, management’s evaluation of any new information indicating that production will likely not occur or may be significantly reduced in the future, or otherwise that the Company\\'s stream and royalty interest balance may not be recoverable, requires significant judgment.\"\\r\\nFINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,\"We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process over the impairment assessment. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s process for identifying and evaluating potential impairment triggers and related significant assumptions and judgments. To test the Company’s impairment assessment, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions, judgments and operating data used in the Company’s analysis. Specifically, we compared forecasted gold, silver, copper and other metal prices to available market information, and we corroborated reserve information to available operator or publicly available information. We involved our specialist and searched for and evaluated other publicly available information that corroborates or contradicts the reserve estimates or indicates that production from mineral interests will not likely occur or may be significantly reduced in the future. We also considered the professional qualifications and objectivity of management’s specialists and the reputation of the third-party operators.

In evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers both positive and negative evidence that may exist, such as earnings history, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies in each tax jurisdiction.

We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution could result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.

A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. In accordance with this guidance, revenue attributable to our stream interests and royalty interests is generally recognized at the point in time that control of the related metal production transfers to our customers. The amount of revenue we recognize further reflects the consideration to which we are entitled under the respective stream or royalty agreement. A more detailed summary of our revenue recognition policies for our stream and royalty interests is discussed below.\"\\r\\nFINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,\"A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more of the metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement. Gold, silver and copper received under our metal stream agreements are taken into inventory, and then sold primarily using average spot rate gold, silver and copper forward contracts. The sales price for these average spot rate forward contracts is determined by the average daily gold, silver or copper spot prices during the term of the contract, typically a consecutive number of trading days between ten days and three months (depending on the frequency of deliveries under the respective stream agreement and our sales policy in effect at the time) commencing shortly after receipt and purchase of the metal. We settle our forward sales contracts via physical delivery of the metal to the purchaser (our customer) on the settlement date specified in the contract. Under our forward sales contracts, there is a single performance obligation to sell a contractually specified volume of metal to the purchaser, and we satisfy this obligation at the point in time of physical delivery. Accordingly, revenue from our metal sales is recognized on the date of settlement, which is the date that control, custody and title to the metal transfer to the purchaser.\"\\r\\nFINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,\"Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to a percentage of revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. We are entitled to payment for our royalty interest in a mining project based on a contractually specified commodity price (for example, a monthly or quarterly average spot price) for the period in which metal production occurred. As a royalty holder, we act as a passive entity in the production and operations of the mining project, and the third-party operator of the mining project is responsible for all mining activities, including subsequent marketing and delivery of all metal production to their ultimate customer. In all of our material royalty interest arrangements, we have concluded that we transfer control of our interest in the metal production to the operator at the point at which production occurs, and thus, the operator is our customer. We have further determined that the transfer of each unit of metal production, comprising our royalty interest, to the operator represents a separate performance obligation under the contract, and each performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time of metal production by the operator. Accordingly, we recognize revenue attributable to our royalty interests in the period in which metal production occurs at the specified commodity price per the agreement, net of any contractually allowable offsite treatment, refining, transportation and, if applicable, other contractually permitted costs.\"\\r\\nFINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,\"For a small number of our royalty interests, we may not receive, or be entitled to receive, payment information, including production information from the operator, for the period in which metal production occurred prior to issuance of our financial statements. As a result, we may estimate revenue for these royalties based on available information, including public information, from the operator. If adequate information is not available from the operator or from other public sources before we issue our financial statements, we will recognize royalty revenue during the period in which the necessary payment information is received.

This decrease was partially offset by higher silver sales at Khoemacau when compared to the prior year. Cost of sales, which excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, is specific to our stream agreements and is the result of our purchase of gold, silver and copper for a cash payment. The cash payment for gold from Mount Milligan is the lesser of $435 per ounce or the prevailing market price of gold when purchased, while the cash payment for our other streams is a set contractual percentage of the gold, silver or copper (Mount Milligan) spot price near the date of metal delivery.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"General and administrative costs increased to $39.8 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02023, from $34.6 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02022.

The decrease was primarily due to lower depletion rates at Pueblo Viejo as a result of proven and probable mineral reserve increases when compared to the prior year. The decrease was partially offset by higher depletion expense at Khoemacau due to the ramp-up of production in 2023 and additional depletion from the newly acquired royalties at Cortez in 2022.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"There were no impairment charges on any of our stream or royalty interests for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The decrease over the prior period was primarily due to the new royalty acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2022.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"Net cash used in financing activities totaled $427.4 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02023, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $480.6 million for the year ended December\\xa031,\\xa02022. The change was primarily due to an increase in the debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $575 million that was used to fund acquisitions of our new royalty interests at Cortez and the Great Bear Project, and the repayment of $325 million of debt outstanding during the current period.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"The preparation of our financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"We rely on mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates reported by the operators of the properties on which we hold stream and royalty interests. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the potential impairments of long-lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets. These estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which we recognize revenue or charge depreciation, depletion and amortization to earnings. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions; however, actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Differences between estimates and actual amounts are adjusted and recorded in the period that the actual amounts are known.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"Stream and royalty interests include acquired stream and royalty interests in production, development and exploration stage properties. The costs of acquired stream and royalty interests are capitalized as tangible assets as such interests do not meet the definition of a financial asset.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"Production stage stream and royalty interests are depleted using the units of production method over the life of the mineral property (as stream sales occur or royalty payments are recognized), which are estimated using proven and probable mineral reserves as provided by the operator. Development stage mineral properties, which are not yet in production, are not depleted until the property begins production. Exploration stage mineral properties, where there are no proven and probable mineral reserves, are not depleted. When the associated exploration stage mineral interests are converted to proven and probable mineral reserves, the mineral property becomes a development stage mineral property.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability of the carrying value of stream and royalty interests in production and development stage mineral properties is evaluated based upon estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from each stream and royalty interest using estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves, mineral resources and other relevant information received from the operators. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of royalty interests in exploration stage mineral properties in the event of significant decreases in the price of gold, silver, copper and other metals, and whenever new information regarding the mineral properties is obtained from the operator indicating that production will not likely occur or may be reduced in the future, thus potentially affecting the\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"future recoverability of our stream or royalty interests. Impairments in the carrying value of each property are measured and recorded to the extent that the carrying value in each property exceeds its estimated fair value, which is generally calculated using estimated future discounted cash flows.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"Estimates of gold, silver, copper, and other metal prices, and operators’ estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves or mineral resources related to our stream or royalty properties are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may affect the recoverability of our investment in these stream and royalty interests in mineral properties. It is possible that changes could occur to these estimates, which could adversely affect the net cash flows expected to be generated from these stream and royalty interests. Refer to Note\\xa04 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment assessment results for the years ended December 31,\\xa02023 and 2022.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer control of a distinct good or service (or integrated package of goods and/or services) to a customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. In accordance with this guidance, revenue attributable to our stream and royalty interests is generally recognized at the point in time that control of the related metal production transfers to our customers, as described below. The amount of revenue we recognize further reflects the consideration to which we are entitled under the respective stream or royalty agreement. A more detailed summary of our revenue recognition policies for our stream and royalty interests is discussed below.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more of the metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement. Gold, silver and copper received under our metal stream agreements are taken into inventory, and then sold primarily using average spot rate gold, silver and copper forward contracts. The sales price for these average spot rate forward contracts is determined by the average daily gold, silver or copper spot prices during the term of the contract, typically a consecutive number of trading days between ten days and three months (depending on the frequency of deliveries under the respective stream agreement and our sales policy in effect at the time) commencing shortly after receipt and purchase of the metal. We settle our forward sales contracts via physical delivery of the metal to the purchaser (our customer) on the settlement date specified in the contract. Under our forward sales contracts, there is a single performance obligation to sell a contractually specified volume of metal to the purchaser, and we satisfy this obligation at the point in time of physical delivery. Accordingly, revenue from our metal sales is recognized on the date of settlement, which is the date that control, custody and title to the metal transfer to the purchaser.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to a percentage of revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any. We are entitled to payment for our royalty interest in a mining project based on a contractually specified commodity price (for example, a monthly or quarterly average spot price) for the period in which metal production occurred. As a royalty holder, we act as a passive entity in the production and operations of the mining project, and the third-party operator of the mining project is responsible for all mining activities, including subsequent marketing and delivery of all metal production to their ultimate customer. In all of our material royalty interest arrangements, we have concluded that we transfer control of our interest in the metal production to the operator at the point at which production occurs, and thus, the operator is our customer. We have further determined that the transfer of each unit of metal production, comprising our royalty interest, to the operator represents a separate performance obligation under the contract, and each performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time of metal production by the operator. Accordingly, we recognize revenue attributable to our royalty interests in the period in which metal production occurs at the specified commodity price per the agreement, net of any contractually allowable offsite treatment, refining, transportation and, if applicable, other contractually permitted costs.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"Our annual tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates in effect and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax expense, current tax assets and liabilities, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income, both as a whole and in various tax jurisdictions, for purposes of assessing our ability to realize future benefit from our deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate or unpredicted results from the final determination of each\\xa0year’s liability by taxing authorities.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"We treat global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) as a period cost and therefore do not record deferred tax impacts of GILTI in our consolidated financial statements. Our deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws and regulations. In evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers both positive and negative evidence that may exist, such as earnings history, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies in each tax jurisdiction. A valuation allowance may be established to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is considered more likely than not to be realized through the generation of future taxable income and other tax planning strategies.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"Our operations may involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution could result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period which they are determined. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\"\\r\\nMANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,\"This report and our other public communications include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws.
