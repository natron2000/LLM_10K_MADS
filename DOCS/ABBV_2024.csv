BUSINESS,NarrativeText,"""AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date.

RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Risks Related to AbbVie's Business
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses, including the loss of exclusivity for any of our products and increased competition from generics and biosimilars, may adversely affect AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic or biosimilar competition."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products continue to expand into the biotechnology field and form partnerships to pursue biosimilars. Companies have developed and are developing biosimilars that compete with AbbVie’s biologic products. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVie’s biologic products, AbbVie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration of or successful challenges to AbbVie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face increased litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""A significant portion of AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings are derived from several major products. Specifically, Skyrizi, Humira and Rinvoq each represented greater than 10% of AbbVie's total net revenues and, in aggregate, these products accounted for approximately 47% of total net revenues in 2024. Humira has faced competition from biosimilar products in the United States following the loss of exclusivity in 2023. AbbVie anticipates such loss will continue to cause a significant decline in Humira's revenue and could adversely affect AbbVie’s revenues and operating earnings."""

RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments have and are expected to also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses may diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings will be reduced."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. In addition, in its pursuit of valid business opportunities, AbbVie may be required to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that it believes were improperly granted. Resolving an intellectual property infringement or other claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing products and technologies that can be successfully commercialized, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products. Such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant resources have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture or the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives regulatory approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for regulatory approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, """"Business—Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing."""" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, European Union member states and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, as well as federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, contribute to pricing pressures. In particular, the IRA will have the effect of reducing prices and reimbursements for certain of our products, which could significantly impact AbbVie’s results of operations. Under the IRA, the U.S Department of Health and Human Services can effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices can apply as soon as nine years (for small-molecule drugs) or 13 years (for biological products) from their FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. In August 2023, HHS, through the CMS, selected Imbruvica as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026. In August 2024, the CMS published Medicare Part D prices that will be applicable to these medicines, including Imbruvica, beginning January 1, 2026. In January 2025, HHS, through the CMS, selected Vraylar and Linzess as two of the 15 medicines subject to government-set prices in Medicare Part D beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products, including products that generate substantial revenues, could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiration of intellectual property protections. In addition, beginning in January 2025, under the IRA, the 70% coverage gap discount program was replaced by a 10% manufacturer discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and incurred out of pocket drug costs below a $2,000 threshold and a 20% discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2,000 threshold under the new Part D benefit redesign. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant. The IRA has and will continue to meaningfully impact AbbVie’s business strategies and those of others in the pharmaceutical industry. The full impact of the IRA on AbbVie’s business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of our or a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""AbbVie continues to evaluate the impact that the IRA may have on the company. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries may result in additional pricing pressures."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""In major markets worldwide, governments play a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries' pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in revenues and operating earnings."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""AbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. Such disputes could result in AbbVie's loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of AbbVie's commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and current governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. As a result, manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics—including Humira, Skyrizi, Botox and Creon —could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that research, develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. In addition, as AbbVie products lose exclusivity, competition surrounding such products will increase and generic and biosimilar products will increasingly penetrate the markets. Furthermore, consolidation among certain pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or indications they may bring to market. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, have lower prices or better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, or have superior performance features than AbbVie’s products, and this may negatively impact AbbVie’s business and results of operations."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process requiring critical environmental controls, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, labor shortages, supply chain disruption, pandemics, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, such batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""AbbVie uses raw materials and components in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes, including those sourced from single suppliers around the world, and an interruption in the supply of those raw materials and components could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""AbbVie uses raw materials and components in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that may be sourced from single suppliers. The failure of AbbVie's suppliers, and particularly its single-source suppliers, to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Increases in demand on any of AbbVie's suppliers could result in delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of its products and/or product shortages, leading to lost revenue. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals.

FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"""Sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs"""
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"""As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Revenue Recognition,” the Company established provisions for sales rebates in the same period the related product is sold. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $14,304 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates accrued for pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish the rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based on estimates and assumptions, including the determination of the related payer of the rebate based on sales trends, changes in rebate contracts which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms, and the corresponding lag in payment timing.Auditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs, contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate."""
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"""We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. Specifically, we tested management’s controls to evaluate the sufficiency of its reserve estimates by comparing to actual rebates paid, controls over rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete and accurate.To test the sales rebate accruals and assess the historical accuracy of management's estimate for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs, our audit procedures included independently calculating the sales rebate accruals based on historical payments and performing a hindsight analysis on the reserves recorded. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroborating management's estimate of the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions considering industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company’s calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy."""
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"""As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Business Combinations” and in Note 11 under the caption “Fair Value Measures,” the Company recognized contingent consideration liabilities at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date in connection with applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recorded within the consolidated statement of earnings in the period of change. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $21,666 million in contingent consideration liabilities, which represented a ‘Level 3’ fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value and the use of management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the liabilities.Auditing the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities was complex and required significant auditor judgment due to the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model and the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to estimate the fair value of contingent royalty payments. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to the significant assumptions underlying the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Management utilized its expertise within the industry, including commercial dynamics, trends and utilization, to determine certain of these assumptions."""
FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS,NarrativeText,"""We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s contingent consideration liabilities process including, among others, management’s process to establish the significant assumptions and measure the liability. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the determination of fair value. The testing was inclusive of key management review controls to monitor estimated future sales, and to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources.To test the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed agreement, assessing the Monte Carlo simulation model used and testing the key contractual inputs and significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the assumptions and judgments considering observable industry and economic trends, and external data sources. Estimated amounts of future sales were also evaluated for reasonableness. Our procedures included evaluating the data sources used by management in determining its assumptions and, where necessary, included an evaluation of available information that either corroborated or contradicted management’s conclusions. We involved a valuation specialist to assess the Company’s Monte Carlo simulation model and to perform corroborative fair value calculations."""

Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
