BUSINESS,NarrativeText,as amended
BUSINESS,NarrativeText,The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill.
BUSINESS,NarrativeText,"""Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions."""
BUSINESS,NarrativeText,"""During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and the related allocations. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are charged to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings."""

RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Trade receivables may be at risk of higher defaults, and other third-party risks could affect ADM’s ability to obtain inputs if suppliers are unable to perform or face insolvency, as certain supplies may not be attainable due to sanctions and/or restrictions on cross-border payment transactions. The Company could be materially impacted if, in the worst-case scenario, the conflict in Ukraine advances to other countries. The risk to ADM’s business from the war in Israel could increase if it expands into other countries. As the Company continues to monitor geopolitical developments, shipping routes are adjusted accordingly as increased use of technology, including drones, has provided pirates with enhanced capabilities to identify and target vessels. Most attacks on ships in high-risk areas result in boarding, which poses significant safety and security risks to crew and cargo. Piracy and related maritime threats could negatively impact the Company. Crew extractions, potential ransom payments, lease obligations, and expenses related to rerouting vessels to circumvent high-risk areas may result in financial loss. Furthermore, disruptions in shipping schedules may be impacted for an extensive period. In these circumstances, trade policies and the Company’s critical global supply chain and logistical networks could be affected, impairing the Company’s ability to satisfy contractual obligations, and impacting working capital requirements.

RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""The Company requires significant capital, including continuing access to credit markets, to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy. The Company’s working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly. The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, ports, transportation assets, and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulations, and changing safety standards in the industry. Moreover, the expansion of the Company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. Access to credit markets and pricing of the Company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies. Strong credit ratings allow the Company to access cost-competitive tier one commercial paper markets. As of December 31, 2024, the three major credit rating agencies maintained the Company’s credit ratings at investment grade levels with a negative outlook. Further watches, reviews or downgrades could occur.

Ag Services benefited from improved river conditions and an excellent crop in North America, which improved export volumes, while South America Origination margins were negatively impacted by take or pay contracts with railroads. Global Trade market conditions were driven by solid trading and continued structured trade finance opportunities. Crushing saw depressed vegetable oil demand and lower prices primarily driven by increased market supply, imports of used cooking oil, uncertainty with the Producer Tax Credit policy change, and the delay of the European Union's Deforestation Regulation requirements. In Refined Products and Other, North America margins were pressured by an increase in the supply of low carbon intensity feedstock and limited forward sales opportunities caused by the uncertainty around Producers Tax Credit policy transition."""

MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"""In the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment, segment operating profit decreased 40%. The Ag Services subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023. South America Origination margins decreased driven by lower origination volumes and margin compression due to slow farmer selling and higher industry rail freight take or pay agreements. North America grain exports were not competitive with South America, leading to weak exports and costs from a carry market contributed to slow farmer selling, limiting trade opportunities in the first half of the year. Execution in destination marketing as well as effective risk management continued to deliver strong Global Trade results in 2024, though lower than 2023. The Crushing subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023, particularly in North America. Increased industry capacity pressured Crushing margins and an increased supply of competing low carbon intensity feedstocks, and the European Union's Deforestation Regulation delay negatively affected margins. For 2024, there were approximately $20 million of net positive mark-to-market timing effects, compared to approximately $185 million of net positive impacts in 2023. The Crushing subsegment current year operating results also included $76 million of insurance proceeds for the partial settlement of the Decatur East and West insurance claims related to incidents in 2023. The Refined Products and Other (RPO) subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023 as increased pre-treatment capacity at renewable diesel facilities, higher imports of used cooking oil, aggressive competition among food suppliers to serve customer demand, and biofuel policy uncertainty negatively impacted margins.

MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"""Judgments and Uncertainties: Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates).

See Part II. Item 8. Note 9. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information."""
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"""Judgments and Uncertainties: The Company has the option to first qualitatively assess factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company elects not to use this option, or it is determined that qualitative factors alone are not sufficient to conclude whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or it is determined from the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. As part of the Company’s impairment analysis, the fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using both the income and market approaches. Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value, when using a discounted cash flow analysis, of each reporting unit require management to make assumptions including, but not limited to, future expected cash flows of the reporting unit utilizing appropriate revenue growth, EBITDA margins, and discount rates. A decline in the actual cash flows of a reporting unit in future periods, as compared to the projected cash flows used in the discounted cash flow analysis, could result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value. Further, a change in the discount rate, as a result of a change in economic conditions or otherwise, could result in the carrying values of the reporting units exceeding their respective fair values. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates."""

Per the results of the impairment testing within the Nutrition reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Animal Nutrition and Human Nutrition reporting units evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment was in excess of 7% and 32% of its carrying value, respectively, and no impairment was recorded for either of the Nutrition reporting units."""
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"""The Company used a combination of the income and market approaches when performing the quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Animal Nutrition reporting unit. The Company weighted the income approach with a probability weight of 75%, as it is based on the future business plans and growth estimates for the Company’s Animal Nutrition business and thus considers short-term and long-term cash flow expectations for the business. The market approach was weighted less heavily at 25%, as it represents an estimate of fair value based on market guideline companies for which future growth expectations are not precisely known."""
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,The income approach is predicated upon the value of the estimated future cash flows that a business will generate going forward. The Company used the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method under the income approach for the analysis of Animal Nutrition.
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"""The market approach assumes that companies operating in the same industry will share similar characteristics and that values will correlate to those characteristics. Therefore, under the market approach, a comparison of the reporting unit to similar companies whose financial information is publicly available may provide a reasonable basis to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The two forms of the market approach most commonly applied are the Guideline Public Company (GPC) method and the Guideline Merged and Acquired Company (GMAC) method. The Company utilized the GPC method to estimate the fair value of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit under the market approach. The GMAC method was also considered, but ultimately was not relied upon due to the lack of recent transactions that were directly comparable. In the selection of the appropriate market multiples, the Company considered the performance of the business, the size, risks, opportunities, and a comparison of the margins and growth of the Animal Nutrition business compared to the guideline public companies. The estimated fair value calculated by the GPC method was within 5% of the estimated fair value calculated by the income approach."""
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,The Company performed a sensitivity analysis for the significant assumptions used in the goodwill impairment testing analysis for the Animal Nutrition reporting unit. The sensitivities were calculated in isolation using the income approach and keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivities for revenue growth and EBITDA growth do not consider the offsetting impact of a lower discount rate assumption to reflect the reduced risk in estimated future cash flow growth used under the income approach or the related impacts on pricing multiples used under the market approach.

The Company’s investment in Wilmar had a carrying value of $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2024, and a market value of $3.2 billion based on the quoted Singapore Exchange market price, converted to U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate, at December 31, 2024. The Company evaluated several factors in its determination of whether an other-than-temporary impairment had occurred. This included consideration of the short duration of the carrying value being above Wilmar's stock price, the recent performance of Wilmar’s stock price as quoted on the Singapore Exchange, latest consensus analyst forecasts, Wilmar’s long history of earnings and dividends and the Company’s continued representation on Wilmar’s Board. The Company considers its investment in Wilmar a significant and strategic relationship and has the intent and ability to retain its investment in Wilmar for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,The Company is exposed to certain risks inherent to an agricultural-based commodity business. These risks are further described in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""The Company’s Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions segments are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials. As a result, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold. Therefore, margins per volume or metric ton generally are meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""The Company's Nutrition segment also utilizes agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold.

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in approximately 80 countries. For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except for certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency, and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. For the majority of the Company’s business activities in Brazil and Argentina, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency. Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar."""

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""The Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company’s operating results, including those discussed below related to 2024."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""In the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment, following two years of very favorable market conditions, several headwinds in the agriculture cycle, including fewer market dislocations and high cost inflation, led to more normalized results throughout the entire value chain. Ag Services benefited from improved river conditions and an excellent crop in North America, which improved export volumes, while South America Origination margins were negatively impacted by take or pay contracts with railroads. Global Trade market conditions were driven by solid trading and continued structured trade finance opportunities. Crushing saw depressed vegetable oil demand and lower prices primarily driven by increased market supply, imports of used cooking oil, uncertainty with the Producer Tax Credit policy change, and the delay of the European Union's Deforestation Regulation requirements. In Refined Products and Other, North America margins were pressured by an increase in the supply of low carbon intensity feedstock and limited forward sales opportunities caused by the uncertainty around Producers Tax Credit policy transition."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""In the Carbohydrate Solutions segment, demand for starches and sweeteners remained solid with margins remaining steady across the entire portfolio. Strong export demand for ethanol helped offset higher industry production to minimize the imbalance between supply and demand."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""In the Nutrition segment, demand was mixed in a few food and beverage product categories driven by shifts in consumer discretionary spend and preferences. Human Nutrition was impacted by inflation, which drove lower demand and decreased volumes for alternative proteins in some regions. Demand started to recover in the food, beverage, and dietary supplement categories. In Animal Nutrition, a soft amino acids market driven by price weakness in North America was partially offset by an improved market in EMEA. The global feed market saw some modest improvement with continued price weakness of main feed ration commodities, while key livestock prices remained steady. The feed additives market was impacted by volatility on vitamins due to supply disruptions, however overall it modestly improved, following the improvement in the feed sector."""

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. The overall increase in oilseeds processed volumes was primarily related to improved crush capacity in North America, driven by the Company's new facility in Spiritwood, North Dakota, and in EMEA in 2024 compared to lower crush rates in the previous year due to inclement weather, unplanned downtime, and reduced capacity due to the Russian-Ukraine war. The overall increase in corn processed volumes was related to increased plant reliability in 2024 compared to lower volumes in the previous year driven by unplanned downtime at the Decatur, Illinois plant."""

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""In the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment, segment operating profit decreased 40%. The Ag Services subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023. South America Origination margins decreased driven by lower origination volumes and margin compression due to slow farmer selling and higher industry rail freight take or pay agreements. North America grain exports were not competitive with South America, leading to weak exports and costs from a carry market contributed to slow farmer selling, limiting trade opportunities in the first half of the year. Execution in destination marketing as well as effective risk management continued to deliver strong Global Trade results in 2024, though lower than 2023. The Crushing subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023, particularly in North America. Increased industry capacity pressured Crushing margins and an increased supply of competing low carbon intensity feedstocks, and the European Union's Deforestation Regulation delay negatively affected margins. For 2024, there were approximately $20 million of net positive mark-to-market timing effects, compared to approximately $185 million of net positive impacts in 2023. The Crushing subsegment current year operating results also included $76 million of insurance proceeds for the partial settlement of the Decatur East and West insurance claims related to incidents in 2023. The Refined Products and Other (RPO) subsegment operating profit was lower than 2023 as increased pre-treatment capacity at renewable diesel facilities, higher imports of used cooking oil, aggressive competition among food suppliers to serve customer demand, and biofuel policy uncertainty negatively impacted margins.

The prior year was impacted by a revaluation loss of $19 million related to an investment in precision fermentation. Flavors results were higher than the prior year driven by current year acquisitions, and a prior year $45 million negative impact primarily related to the deconsolidation and write-down of a joint venture.

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,Description: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting standards which prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,Judgments and Uncertainties: ADM calculates its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax attributes available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company uses judgment in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision.
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: While ADM considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the Company faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. The Company recognizes a tax position in its Consolidated Financial Statements when it is determined to be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on its technical merits. The position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement."""

The Company accounts for any redeemable non-controlling interest in temporary equity - redeemable non-controlling interest at redemption value with periodic changes recorded in retained earnings."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Judgments and Uncertainties: Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and related allocations.

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Description: Goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired. At December 31, 2024, the Company had goodwill of $4.5 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1 or more frequently whenever there are indicators that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable, utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method. The Company has seven reporting units with goodwill identified at one level below the operating segment using the criteria in ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). Two reporting units do not have any recorded goodwill. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment for two reporting units and using a quantitative assessment for five reporting units. See Part II. Item 8. Note 9. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Judgments and Uncertainties: The Company has the option to first qualitatively assess factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company elects not to use this option, or it is determined that qualitative factors alone are not sufficient to conclude whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or it is determined from the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. As part of the Company’s impairment analysis, the fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using both the income and market approaches. Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value, when using a discounted cash flow analysis, of each reporting unit require management to make assumptions including, but not limited to, future expected cash flows of the reporting unit utilizing appropriate revenue growth, EBITDA margins, and discount rates. A decline in the actual cash flows of a reporting unit in future periods, as compared to the projected cash flows used in the discounted cash flow analysis, could result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value. Further, a change in the discount rate, as a result of a change in economic conditions or otherwise, could result in the carrying values of the reporting units exceeding their respective fair values. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: Per the results of the impairment testing within the Ag Services and Oilseeds (AS&O) reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Ag Services, Crushing, and RPO reporting units evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment was in excess of 128%, 191% and 209% of its carrying value, respectively, and no impairment was recorded for any of the AS&O reporting units. Per the results of the impairment testing within the Nutrition reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Animal Nutrition and Human Nutrition reporting units evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment was in excess of 7% and 32% of its carrying value, respectively, and no impairment was recorded for either of the Nutrition reporting units."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""The Company used a combination of the income and market approaches when performing the quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Animal Nutrition reporting unit. The Company weighted the income approach with a probability weight of 75%, as it is based on the future business plans and growth estimates for the Company’s Animal Nutrition business and thus considers short-term and long-term cash flow expectations for the business. The market approach was weighted less heavily at 25%, as it represents an estimate of fair value based on market guideline companies for which future growth expectations are not precisely known."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,The income approach is predicated upon the value of the estimated future cash flows that a business will generate going forward. The Company used the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method under the income approach for the analysis of Animal Nutrition.
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""The market approach assumes that companies operating in the same industry will share similar characteristics and that values will correlate to those characteristics. Therefore, under the market approach, a comparison of the reporting unit to similar companies whose financial information is publicly available may provide a reasonable basis to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. The two forms of the market approach most commonly applied are the Guideline Public Company (GPC) method and the Guideline Merged and Acquired Company (GMAC) method. The Company utilized the GPC method to estimate the fair value of the Animal Nutrition reporting unit under the market approach. The GMAC method was also considered, but ultimately was not relied upon due to the lack of recent transactions that were directly comparable. In the selection of the appropriate market multiples, the Company considered the performance of the business, the size, risks, opportunities, and a comparison of the margins and growth of the Animal Nutrition business compared to the guideline public companies. The estimated fair value calculated by the GPC method was within 5% of the estimated fair value calculated by the income approach."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,The Company performed a sensitivity analysis for the significant assumptions used in the goodwill impairment testing analysis for the Animal Nutrition reporting unit. The sensitivities were calculated in isolation using the income approach and keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivities for revenue growth and EBITDA growth do not consider the offsetting impact of a lower discount rate assumption to reflect the reduced risk in estimated future cash flow growth used under the income approach or the related impacts on pricing multiples used under the market approach.
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""As of December 31, 2024, goodwill allocated to the Animal Nutrition reporting unit totaled $887 million. For Animal Nutrition impairment testing, certain hypotheticals would have the following results:"""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,A hypothetical increase to the discount rate of approximately 100 basis points would result in a goodwill impairment of approximately $68 million;
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,A hypothetical decrease to forecasted EBITDA margins of approximately 50 basis points would result in goodwill impairment of approximately $5 million; and
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,A hypothetical decrease in the expected annual revenue growth rate over the entire forecast of approximately 250 basis points would result in a goodwill impairment of approximately $69 million.
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Description: The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, including its 22.5% investment in Wilmar. These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee. Generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee. However, the Company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Judgments and Uncertainties: The Company has evaluated its investments in affiliates as of December 31, 2024 to be appropriately stated at carrying values. The Company also periodically compares the book value of its investment in Wilmar against its market value as determined through quoted market prices, and evaluates any potential other-than-temporary impairment. The Company’s investment in Wilmar had a carrying value of $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2024, and a market value of $3.2 billion based on the quoted Singapore Exchange market price, converted to U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate, at December 31, 2024. The Company evaluated several factors in its determination of whether an other-than-temporary impairment had occurred. This included consideration of the short duration of the carrying value being above Wilmar's stock price, the recent performance of Wilmar’s stock price as quoted on the Singapore Exchange, latest consensus analyst forecasts, Wilmar’s long history of earnings and dividends and the Company’s continued representation on Wilmar’s Board. The Company considers its investment in Wilmar a significant and strategic relationship and has the intent and ability to retain its investment in Wilmar for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Based on the evaluation of the factors above, the Company does not consider the investment to be other-than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2024."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: The performance of impairment tests involves the use of estimates and assumptions, which may change period to period.
