RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""The software industry is characterized by rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences. In recent years, the industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premises products to subscriptions and cloud-enabled technologies. Both new and existing customers are also reconsidering how they purchase software products, which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy. In response, we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects. We devote significant resources to the development of new technologies. If we are unable to provide new features, enhancements to user experience, and modifications in a timely and cost-effective manner that achieve market acceptance, align with customer expectations, and that keep pace with rapid technological developments and changing regulatory landscapes, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. For example, AI and machine learning are propelling advancements in technology, but if they are not widely adopted and accepted or fail to operate as expected, our business and reputation may be harmed."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""In addition, we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources, such as our introduction of flexible subscription and service offerings and our transition of multi-subscription plans to named-user plans. It is uncertain whether these strategies, including our product and pricing changes, will accurately reflect customer demand or be successful, or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. We make such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services, as well as through acquisitions. Such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue or profitability. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, either with respect to new customers or existing customers, and either with respect to our software or the manner in which we provide such products, or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers’ requirements, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely impacted."""

RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Global economic and political conditions may further impact our industries, business, and financial results."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions. The United States and other countries’ economies have experienced cyclical downturns, in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, decreased government spending, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity, and foreign exchange markets, inflationary pressures and higher interest rates, bankruptcies, and overall uncertainty. These economic conditions can occur abruptly. For example, current geopolitical and global macro-economic challenges have caused uncertainty in the global economy, and an economic downturn or recession in the United States or in other countries may occur or has already occurred and may continue. The extent to which these challenges will impact our financial condition or results of operations is still uncertain and will continue to depend on developments such as the impact of these challenges on our customers, vendors, distributors, and resellers, such as the supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures and global labor shortage that we have seen recently, material scarcity, as well as other factors; actions taken by governments, businesses, and consumers in response to these challenges; speed and timing of economic recovery, including in specific geographies; our billings and renewal rates, including new business close rates, rate of multi-year contracts, pace of closing larger transactions, and new unit volume growth; wars and armed conflicts, including the ongoing wars between the Ukraine and Russia and between Israel and Hamas; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; and the effect of these challenges on margins and cash flow. All of these factors continue to evolve and remain uncertain at this time, and some of these factors are not within our control.

Political instability or adverse political developments in any of the countries in which we do business could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers, including our distribution partners and channels.

RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Our strategy to digitize Autodesk involves increasing our use of cloud- and web-based technologies and applications to leverage customer data to improve our offerings for the benefit of our customers. To accomplish this strategy, we must collect and otherwise process customer data, which may include personal data and personal information of users from different jurisdictions globally. We also collect and otherwise process personal data and personal information of our employees and contractors. As a result, federal, state, and global laws relating to privacy, data protection, and information security apply to Autodesk’s personal data and personal information processing activities. The scope of these laws and regulations is rapidly evolving, subject to differing interpretations, may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, or conflict with other rules and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. Globally, laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) in the European Union (“EU”) and the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”) in China have been enacted, and numerous other countries have proposed or have enacted laws concerning privacy, data protection, and information security. In addition, new and emerging state laws in the United States governing privacy, data protection, and information security, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), and numerous laws in other states, many of which provide for obligations similar to the CCPA and CPRA, have been enacted. These laws and regulations, as well as industry self-regulatory codes, industry standards, and other actual and asserted obligations to which we are or may be asserted to be subject, create new compliance obligations and substantially expand the scope of potential liability and provide greater penalties for non-compliance. For example, the GDPR provides for penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of a company’s annual global revenue, whichever is greater, the PIPL provides for penalties of up to 50 million renminbi or 5% of a company's annual revenue and disgorgement of all illegal gains, whichever is greater, and the CCPA provides for penalties of up to $7,500 per violation.

RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""In addition, the United Kingdom’s (“UK”) exit from the EU, and ongoing developments in the UK, have created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK. Data processing in the UK is now governed by the UK General Data Protection Regulation and supplemented by other domestic data protection laws, such as the UK Data Protection Act 2018, which authorizes fines of up to £17.5 million or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is higher. We are also exposed to potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain violations. Furthermore, the new SCCs apply only to the transfer of personal data outside the EU and not the UK. Although the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the UK on June 28, 2021, allowing the continued flow of personal data from the EU to the UK, this decision will be regularly reviewed going forward and may be revoked if the UK diverges from its current adequate data protection laws following its exit from the EU. On February 2, 2022, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office issued new standard contractual clauses to support personal data transfers out of the UK (“UK SCCs”), which became effective March 21, 2022. We may, in addition to other impacts, experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens and be required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing personal data on our behalf or localize certain personal data. On March 25, 2022, the United States and EU announced an “agreement in principle” to replace the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield transfer framework with the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”). On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the EU-U.S. DPF, allowing the EU-U.S. DPF to be utilized as a means of legitimizing EU-U.S. personal data transfers for participating entities. We are evaluating whether the EU-U.S. DPF will be appropriate for us to utilize. The EU-U.S. DPF may be subject to legal challenges from privacy advocacy groups or others, and the European Commission’s adequacy decision regarding the EU-U.S. DPF provides that the EU-U.S. DPF will be subject to future reviews and may be subject to suspension, amendment, repeal, or limitations to its scope by the European Commission."""

RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, and trademark laws, trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. While we have patent applications pending in the United States and throughout the world, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, any patents issued to us in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties from time to time have copied or reverse engineered aspects of our software or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our software is time-consuming and costly. We are unable to measure the extent to which unauthorized use of our software exists and we expect that unauthorized use of software will remain a persistent problem, particularly in emerging economies."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Additionally, we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets, including our source code. If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. Unauthorized disclosure of our source code could make it easier for third parties to compete with our offerings by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our employees, customers, contractors, vendors, and partners. However, it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization. If this were to occur, it may be difficult and/or costly for us to enforce our rights, and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,We may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our business. Third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights, even if we are unaware of the intellectual property rights claimed against us. As more software patents are granted worldwide, the number of offerings and competitors in our industries grows, and the functionality of products in different industries overlaps, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims. Additionally, certain patent assertion entities have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Any claims or threats of infringement or misappropriation, whether with or without merit, have been and could in the future be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, cause product delays, require us to change our products or business practices, prevent us from offering our software and services, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, such royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, which would likely harm our business. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications, or refund fees, which could be costly. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,Contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process.

RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""Because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. We use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow, revenue and expense exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As part of our risk management strategy, we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets, liabilities, and other obligations, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. These foreign currency instruments may have maturities that extend for one to 18 months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures. However, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results."""
RISK_FACTORS,NarrativeText,"""The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given period. Although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility, we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk, and in any case, will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs.

MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"""To support our strategic priority of digital transformation in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (“AEC”), we are strengthening our AEC solutions’ foundation with both organic and inorganic investments. In fiscal 2024, we launched the first set of capabilities in Autodesk Forma, an industry cloud that unifies workflows across the teams that design, build, and operate the built environment. Autodesk Forma’s initial capabilities enable the early-stage planning and design process with automation and AI-powered insights that simplify the exploration of design concepts, offload repetitive tasks, and help evaluate environmental qualities surrounding a building site. In fiscal 2023, we acquired a cloud-connected, extended reality (XR) platform enabling AEC professionals to present, collaborate and review projects in immersive and interactive experiences, from anywhere and at any time. This acquisition enables Autodesk to meet increasing needs for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology advancements within the AEC industry and further support AEC customers throughout the project delivery lifecycle. In fiscal 2022, we acquired Storm UK Holdco Limited, the parent of Innovyze, Inc. (“Innovyze”), which provides water infrastructure software. Combining Innovyze’s hydraulic modeling, simulation, asset performance management and operational analytics solutions with Autodesk’s design and analysis solutions (including Autodesk Civil 3D, Autodesk InfraWorks, and the Autodesk Construction Cloud) enables us to deliver end-to-end, cloud-based solutions for our water infrastructure customers that drive efficiency and sustainability. Other acquisitions in fiscal 2022 include a cloud-based estimating solution that enables construction teams to create estimates, perform digital takeoffs, generate detailed reports and proposals and manage bid-day processes. Additionally, in fiscal 2022, we launched Autodesk Tandem, a cloud-based digital twin technology platform that extends digital project delivery by providing owner/operators with an easy to use, accurate, digital as-built model of a newly built or renovated facility.

We continually review these factors in making decisions regarding acquisitions. We anticipate that we will continue to acquire products, technology, and businesses as compelling opportunities become available."""
MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION,NarrativeText,"""We sell our products and services globally, through a combination of direct and indirect channels. Our direct channels include, but are not limited to, internal sales resources focused on selling our highly specialized solutions in our largest accounts, Solution Providers focused on serving certain Flex and subscription customers through our new transaction model, and business transacted through our online Autodesk branded store. Our indirect channels primarily include value added distributors, value added resellers, direct market resellers, volume channel partners, and product-specific resellers. During fiscal 2023, we entered into transition agreements with certain of our distributors, including TD Synnex and Ingram Micro, to provide transition distribution activities for a one-to-two-year period, with potential extensions. In connection with the transition agreements, Autodesk intends to increase its selling efforts with value-added resellers and Solution Providers.  We introduced a new transaction model for our token-based Flex offering in North America, and certain countries in EMEA and APAC, and for most of our subscription offerings in Australia during fiscal 2024, whereby channel partners provide a quote to customers but the actual transaction occurs directly between Autodesk and the customer. Dependent upon successful implementation in Australia, we intend to transition our indirect business to the new transaction model in our major markets globally in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026.  We expect the change in accounting recognition of sales incentives to indirect channels from contra revenue to operating expenses under the new transaction model to positively impact calculated revenue growth, while being broadly neutral to calculated operating profit and free cash flow dollars, and to result in a calculated negative impact to operating margin.

Historically, we have had increased EBA sales activity in our fourth fiscal quarter and this seasonality may affect the relative value of our billings, RPO, and cash collections in the fourth and first fiscal quarters. As customers transition from multi-year subscription contracts billed upfront to annual billing installments, some customers may choose annual contracts instead. If this were to occur, we would expect it to proportionately reduce the unbilled portion of our total remaining performance obligations and would expect it to impact total RPO growth rates negatively.

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Autodesk is changing how the world is designed and made. Our technology spans architecture, engineering, construction, product design, manufacturing, media and entertainment, empowering innovators everywhere to solve challenges big and small. From greener buildings to smarter products to more mesmerizing blockbusters, Autodesk technology helps our customers to design and make a better world for all."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Our strategy is to deliver a trusted design and make platform that connects people through automation, data, and insights to help them achieve better outcomes for their businesses and the world. To drive the execution of our strategy, we are focused on three strategic priorities: build the platform of choice for Design and Make, accelerate adoption of Fusion, Forma, and Flow, and transform how customers experience Autodesk."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""We equip and inspire our users with the tailored tools, services, and access they need for success today and tomorrow. At every step, we help users harness the power of data to build upon their ideas and explore new ways of imagining, collaborating, and creating to achieve better outcomes for their customers, for society, and for the world. And because creativity can’t flourish in silos, we connect what matters - from steps in a project to collaborators on a unified platform."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""We offer subscriptions for individual products and Industry Collections, enterprise business arrangements (“EBAs”), and cloud service offerings (collectively referred to as “subscription plans”). Subscription plans are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our offerings and to attract a broader range of customers, such as project-based users and small businesses."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Our subscription plans represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. Our cloud offerings, for example, Autodesk Construction Cloud, Autodesk Build, Fusion, Flow Production Tracking, AutoCAD web app, and AutoCAD mobile app, provide tools, including mobile and collaboration capabilities, to streamline design, collaboration, building and manufacturing, and data management processes. We believe that customer adoption of these latest offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these services."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Industry Collections provide our customers with access to a broader selection of Autodesk solutions and services, simplifying the customers’ ability to benefit from a complete set of tools for their industry."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""To support our strategic priority of digital transformation in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (“AEC”), we are strengthening our AEC solutions’ foundation with both organic and inorganic investments. In fiscal 2024, we launched the first set of capabilities in Autodesk Forma, an industry cloud that unifies workflows across the teams that design, build, and operate the built environment. Autodesk Forma’s initial capabilities enable the early-stage planning and design process with automation and AI-powered insights that simplify the exploration of design concepts, offload repetitive tasks, and help evaluate environmental qualities surrounding a building site. In fiscal 2023, we acquired a cloud-connected, extended reality (XR) platform enabling AEC professionals to present, collaborate and review projects in immersive and interactive experiences, from anywhere and at any time. This acquisition enables Autodesk to meet increasing needs for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology advancements within the AEC industry and further support AEC customers throughout the project delivery lifecycle. In fiscal 2022, we acquired Storm UK Holdco Limited, the parent of Innovyze, Inc. (“Innovyze”), which provides water infrastructure software. Combining Innovyze’s hydraulic modeling, simulation, asset performance management and operational analytics solutions with Autodesk’s design and analysis solutions (including Autodesk Civil 3D, Autodesk InfraWorks, and the Autodesk Construction Cloud) enables us to deliver end-to-end, cloud-based solutions for our water infrastructure customers that drive efficiency and sustainability. Other acquisitions in fiscal 2022 include a cloud-based estimating solution that enables construction teams to create estimates, perform digital takeoffs, generate detailed reports and proposals and manage bid-day processes. Additionally, in fiscal 2022, we launched Autodesk Tandem, a cloud-based digital twin technology platform that extends digital project delivery by providing owner/operators with an easy to use, accurate, digital as-built model of a newly built or renovated facility. This accelerates operational readiness and extends the value of BIM downstream into the owner/operator segment."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""In manufacturing, our strategy is to combine organic and acquired software in existing and adjacent verticals to create end-to-end, cloud-based solutions for our customers that drive efficiency and sustainability. We continue to attract global manufacturing leaders and disruptive startups with our generative design and cloud-based Fusion that converges the design process with manufacturing. In fiscal 2024, we acquired a provider of simulation technology that enables factory and logistics center operators to optimize their processes. In fiscal 2023, we acquired a maker of software for optimizing manufacturing processes with automation and digitization from the shop floor upward that provides a real-time system of record for data collection, management, and analysis. In fiscal 2022, we acquired Upchain, an instant-on, cloud-based data management technology that allows product design and manufacturing customers to collaborate in the cloud across their value chains and bring products to market faster."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology, and businesses. Acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers; however, they entail cost and integration challenges and may, in certain instances, negatively impact our operating margins. We continually review these factors in making decisions regarding acquisitions. We anticipate that we will continue to acquire products, technology, and businesses as compelling opportunities become available."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""We sell our products and services globally, through a combination of direct and indirect channels. Our direct channels include, but are not limited to, internal sales resources focused on selling our highly specialized solutions in our largest accounts, Solution Providers focused on serving certain Flex and subscription customers through our new transaction model, and business transacted through our online Autodesk branded store. Our indirect channels primarily include value added distributors, value added resellers, direct market resellers, volume channel partners, and product-specific resellers. During fiscal 2023, we entered into transition agreements with certain of our distributors, including TD Synnex and Ingram Micro, to provide transition distribution activities for a one-to-two-year period, with potential extensions. In connection with the transition agreements, Autodesk intends to increase its selling efforts with value-added resellers and Solution Providers.  We introduced a new transaction model for our token-based Flex offering in North America, and certain countries in EMEA and APAC, and for most of our subscription offerings in Australia during fiscal 2024, whereby channel partners provide a quote to customers but the actual transaction occurs directly between Autodesk and the customer. Dependent upon successful implementation in Australia, we intend to transition our indirect business to the new transaction model in our major markets globally in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026.  We expect the change in accounting recognition of sales incentives to indirect channels from contra revenue to operating expenses under the new transaction model to positively impact calculated revenue growth, while being broadly neutral to calculated operating profit and free cash flow dollars, and to result in a calculated negative impact to operating margin. See Part II, Item 8, Note 2, """"Revenue Recognition"""" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the results of our indirect and direct channel sales for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""We anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change as we scale our business. With the continued growth of our online Autodesk branded store, the transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts and our new token-based Flex model, and the introduction of our new transaction model, we are transacting directly with more end customers, rather than through distributors, without substantial disruption to our revenue. We expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support a considerable portion of our customers. We also expect our transition to annual billings for multi-year contracts to impact the timing of our billings and cash collections. We employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies."""

These include foundational capabilities to make our offers safer, faster, easier, and globally scalable, as well as capabilities that can accelerate new sources of value for our customers."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""One example of these shared capabilities is Autodesk AI. We have been investing in AI for over a decade. Our focus is on building AI capabilities that add value to our customers’ workloads through augmentation, automation and analysis."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""One of our key strategies is to maintain an API based architecture of our software products to facilitate third-party development of complementary products and industry-specific software solutions. This approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses. We offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding, technological platforms, user communities, technical support, forums, and events to developers who develop add-on applications for our products. For example, we have established the Autodesk Platform Services to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed, made, and used."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""In addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology, our large global network of distributors, resellers, Solution Providers, third-party developers, customers, educators, educational institutions, learning partners, and students is a key competitive advantage that has been cultivated over an extensive period. This network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets worldwide. Our distributor, reseller and Solution Provider network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase, deploy, learn, and support our solutions quickly and easily.

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""Our significant accounting policies are described in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that of all our significant accounting policies, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the accounting policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,Our contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and value delivered to the customer and the interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities.
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""For our product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible enterprise business arrangements, the functional nature of the promise, as well as the customers’ value expectations, led us to conclude desktop applications and cloud functionalities are not distinct in the context of the contract and should be accounted for as a single performance obligation. There is a high degree of interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities, which is not available with the desktop applications alone or in conjunction with third-party cloud service providers. Furthermore, customers are not able to use the desktop applications for its intended purpose without our cloud functionalities."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""For contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""We establish SSP for most of our products and services based on observable prices when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer and circumstance. In these instances, we use relevant information such as the product type or sales channel to determine the SSP."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying value is adjusted for our strategic investment equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. The determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""These assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment. Whenever possible, we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value."""
MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,"""We assess our strategic investment debt and equity securities portfolio quarterly for impairment. Strategic investment equity securities are assessed based on available information such as current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance, and any other readily available market data. For any available-for-sale debt securities, if Autodesk does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that Autodesk will be required to sell the available-for-sale debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, Autodesk will determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related factors. The credit loss is measured as the amount by which the debt security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, up to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value. Impairment will be assessed at the individual security level. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding adjustment to “Interest and"""

MANAGEMENT,NarrativeText,The key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset group over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other intangible assets that have finite lives.
